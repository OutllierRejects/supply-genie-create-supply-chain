- ENSURE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DATA: Every supplier must have all required fields filled with realistic, verifiable information

MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE:

   - Does this supplier meet all requirements?
   - What is their reputation and track record?
   - How do they compare to other options?
   - Are they a good strategic fit?

6. EXIT CRITERIA CHECK: After each supplier candidate, ask yourself:
   "Do I already have {AGENT_MAX_SUPPLIERS} suppliers that meet ALL constraints and requirements?"
